Support vector machine (SVM) benchmarks for the machine leraning predictions of
band gaps of semiconductors.

The training data comes from one study
(Phys. Rev. B 93, 115104 â€“ Published 1 March 2016)
in my former group of Prof. Isao Tanaka at Kyoto University. Since the
license of these data have not been clear, these data need to be
obtained upon reqeust.

This repository includes the machine learning codes written by myself.
